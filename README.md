# Simple Spring Boot Application

I'm experimenting with Spring Boot from the tutorials.

I gave this a silly name, but I do not in fact plan to do anything
related to real ducks with it.

Spring Boot requires a recent Java Development Kit (JDK) and
a build tool.  I chose Apache Maven for the build tool.
